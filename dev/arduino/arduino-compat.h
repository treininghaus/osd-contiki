/**
 * \defgroup Hardware independent Arduino compatibility
 *
 * This file is meant to be included into a compatible Arduino.h
 *
 * Arduino calls the combination of an AVR timer and the corresponding
 * channel a timer. So Arduinos definition of timer is different from
 * that of AVR documentation. Arduino defines arbitrary TIMERXX macros
 * that are later parsed in a big switch statement.
 *
 * We use a better representation of timer values than arduino here:
 * The AVRs have max. 6 (numbered 0-5) timers. For representing these we
 * need 3 bits. In addition each timer can have channels A-D (or just
 * one channel in which case there is no alphabetic suffix). We can
 * represent this in 2 bits. We add one bit to each for future
 * compatibility and come up with 7 bits, still easily represented in 8
 * bit with room for a 'NOT_ON_TIMER' value. From these we can easily
 * compute the channel and timer by shifting. No need for a big switch
 * statement, and -- which is the common case -- when initializing with
 * a constant for the pin, the compiler can compute everything at
 * compile-time (that's why the analogWrite below is implemented as a
 * static inline function).
 *
 * Note that Arduino also defines some TIMERX without an alphabetic
 * suffix (e.g. TIMER2). I suspect this is for microcontrollers that
 * only have one channel for a certain timer. So this is currently
 * defined the same as TIMER2A because they are never used together.
 * This may be wrong and may be a bug.
 *
 * Note that the hardware definition still has to define a
 * digitalPinToTimer macro. We suggest to not implement this with a
 * static table in program memory (as currently done by arduino) but
 * instead as an if-cascade (as a C-macro). This allows the compiler to
 * completely compute the if-cascade at compile-time if the used pin is
 * a constant, resulting in *much* smaller code-footprint in the most
 * common use-case.
